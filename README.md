Hi there 👋 I'm Aaryan Bastola

I’m an aspiring IT professional currently pursuing a Bachelor of Information Technology, with growing focus in cybersecurity, system development, and problem-solving through technology. I enjoy working on clean, practical solutions and building projects that strengthen my technical foundation.

My interests span across penetration testing, networking fundamentals, programming, and understanding how systems work behind the scenes. I aim to develop a career rooted in continuous learning, clarity, and real-world impact.

I’m currently building my portfolio through hands-on projects, coursework, and independent study—always looking for opportunities to refine my skills and contribute to meaningful tech work.
